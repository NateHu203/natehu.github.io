During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments faced the challenge of balancing pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. This research provides critical insights into their interactive effects on mortality rates.

Key Findings:
* Utilized mobility big data from the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform
* Applied Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to analyze county-level impacts
* Identified specific threshold rates where pharmaceutical treatments begin effectively suppressing mortality
* Demonstrated how non-pharmaceutical interventions can lower these threshold rates

The study provides valuable guidance for policymakers in resource allocation and intervention strategy during public health crises.
