This paper introduces a novel approach to human mobility prediction by incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) to better understand and predict human movement patterns. The key contributions include:

* Development of the Analyze-Abstract-Infer (A2I) Workflow for enhanced reasoning in mobility prediction
* Integration of LLMs to capture and understand human intent in movement patterns
* Implementation of advanced prompt engineering techniques for improved prediction accuracy
